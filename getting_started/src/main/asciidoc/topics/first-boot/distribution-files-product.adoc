=== Installing the Server

The {book_project_name} Server is contained in one distribution file:

* 'RH-SSO-{book_project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]'

The 'RH-SSO-{book_project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]' file is the server-only distribution. It contains only the scripts and binaries
to run the {book_project_name} server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` and `tar` utilities.
