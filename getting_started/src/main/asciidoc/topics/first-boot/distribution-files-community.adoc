=== Installing Distribution Files

The {book_project_name} Server is contained in one distribution file:

* 'keycloak-{book_project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]'

The 'keycloak-{book_project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]' file is the server only distribution.  It contains nothing other than the scripts and binaries
to run the {book_project_name} server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` and `tar` utilities.
